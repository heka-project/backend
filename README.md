# heka-backend

This is a backend service for project heka and is built with redis, NodeJs

## Project Status
---
This is still currently in development as some of the intended functionality is not working and its super messy.

## Why
---
This project is built over a month in prepartion for a 3 day hackathon held by my school for a module in Ngee Ann Polytechnic. The goal of this was to expose myself to working with backend stuff and I must I enjoyed it.
